# Caesar Cipher – SkillCraft Technology Internship Task 01

🔐 This project is a simple Python program that encrypts and decrypts messages using the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm.

---

## 📌 Description

The Caesar Cipher is one of the most well-known and easy encryption techniques. It works by shifting the letters of the message by a fixed number (key).

This script allows the user to:
- Encrypt a message
- Decrypt a message
- Choose the shift value
- Retain spaces and punctuation
